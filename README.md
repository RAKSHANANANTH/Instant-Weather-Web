# React + Vite
# Instant Weather Web 

This is my personal React weather application project.
It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display current conditions and a 5-day forecast.

## Features:
- User login/signup (dummy auth)
- Search by city name
- Get weather by current location
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed
- 5-day forecast
